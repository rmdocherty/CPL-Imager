This is, somewhat misleadingly, a physical 'build' folder, containing all the .stl files needed to assemble the casing as described in the manual. 
The .stl files in this current directory are for the casing, the ones in the 'sample_holder' directory are for sample holders you may wish to print.

Briefly, the circular sample holders are designed to fit in a Thorlabs 30mm cage plate, where the sample is placed in the space between the two plates,
then two Throlabs slip rings are screwed in either side to keep the thing in place. This cage plate with sample holder can then fit on a post or on the
cage system - potentially screwed onto the front of the casing. The sample cube is designed to have a cuvette (or thin film holder shaped like a cuvette)
placed into it. It then sits on a cage system or on a post in the beam path.
